description: Guide for implementing smooth, native-feeling animations using React's View Transition API (`<ViewTransition>` component, `addTransitionType`, and CSS view transition pseudo-elements). Use this skill whenever the user wants to add page transitions, animate route changes, create shared element animations, animate enter/exit of components, animate list reorder, implement directional (forward/back) navigation animations, or integrate view transitions in Next.js. Also use when the user mentions view transitions, `startViewTransition`, `ViewTransition`, transition types, or asks about animating between UI states in React without third-party animation libraries.

# React View Transitions

React's View Transition API lets you animate between UI states using the browser's native `document.startViewTransition` under the hood. Declare *what* to animate with `<ViewTransition>`, trigger *when* with `startTransition` / `useDeferredValue` / `Suspense`, and control *how* with CSS classes or the Web Animations API. Unsupported browsers skip the animation and apply the DOM change instantly.

## When to Animate (and When Not To)

Every `<ViewTransition>` should answer: **what spatial relationship or continuity does this animation communicate to the user?** If you can't articulate it, don't add it.

### Hierarchy of Animation Intent

From highest value to lowest — start from the top and only move down if your app doesn't already have animations at that level:

| Priority | Pattern | What it communicates | Example |
|----------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Shared element** (`name`) | "This is the same thing — I'm going deeper" | List thumbnail morphs into detail hero |
| 2 | **Suspense reveal** | "Data loaded, here's the real content" | Skeleton cross-fades into loaded page |
| 3 | **List identity** (per-item `key`) | "Same items, new arrangement" | Cards reorder during sort/filter |
| 4 | **State change** (`enter`/`exit`) | "Something appeared or disappeared" | Panel slides in on toggle |
| 5 | **Route change** (layout-level) | "Going to a new place" | Cross-fade between pages |

Route-level transitions (#5) are the lowest priority because the URL change already signals a context switch. A blanket cross-fade on every navigation says nothing — it's visual noise. Prefer specific, intentional animations (#1–#4) over ambient page transitions.

**Rule of thumb:** at any given moment, only one level of the tree should be visually transitioning. If your pages already manage their own Suspense reveals or shared element morphs, adding a layout-level route transition on top produces double-animation where both levels fight for attention.

### Choosing the Right Animation Style

Not everything should slide. Match the animation to the spatial relationship:

| Context | Animation | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Detail page main content | `enter="slide-up"` | Reveals "deeper" content the user drilled into |
| Detail page outer wrapper | `enter`/`exit` type map for `nav-forward` | Navigating forward — horizontal direction |
| List / overview pages | Bare `<ViewTransition>` (fade) or `default="none"` | Lateral navigation — no spatial depth to communicate |
| Page headers / breadcrumbs | Bare `<ViewTransition>` (fade) | Small, fast-loading metadata — slide feels excessive |
| Secondary section on same page | `enter="slide-up"` | Second Suspense boundary streaming in after the header |
| Revalidation / background refresh | `default="none"` | Data refreshed silently — animation would be distracting |

When in doubt, use a bare `<ViewTransition>` (default cross-fade) or `default="none"`. Only add directional motion (slide-up, slide-from-right) when it communicates spatial meaning.

**Hierarchical vs. lateral navigation:** Reserve directional `transitionTypes` (like `nav-forward` / `nav-back`) for hierarchical navigation — where the user drills deeper (list → detail) or backs out. For lateral/sibling navigation between pages at the same level (e.g., tab-to-tab or peer sections), use a bare `<ViewTransition>` (cross-fade) or `default="none"` — don't add `transitionTypes`. Directional slides on sibling links falsely imply spatial depth where none exists.

---

## Availability

- `<ViewTransition>` and `addTransitionType` require `react@canary` or `react@experimental`. They are **not** in stable React (including 19.x). Before implementing, verify the project uses canary — check `package.json` for `"react": "canary"` or run `npm ls react`. If on stable, install canary: `npm install react@canary react-dom@canary`.
- Browser support: Chromium 111+, Firefox 144+, Safari 18.2+ (cross-document only). The API gracefully degrades — unsupported browsers skip the animation and apply the DOM change instantly.

---

## Core Concepts

### The `<ViewTransition>` Component

Wrap the elements you want to animate:

```jsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

<ViewTransition>
  <Component />
</ViewTransition>
```

React automatically assigns a unique `view-transition-name` to the nearest DOM node inside each `<ViewTransition>`, and calls `document.startViewTransition` behind the scenes. Never call `startViewTransition` yourself — React coordinates all view transitions and will interrupt external ones. React also waits up to 500ms for fonts to load and delays for images inside `<ViewTransition>` to avoid flicker.

### Animation Triggers

React decides which type of animation to run based on what changed:

| Trigger | When it fires |
|---------|--------------|
| **enter** | A `<ViewTransition>` is first inserted during a Transition |
| **exit** | A `<ViewTransition>` is first removed during a Transition |
| **update** | DOM mutations happen inside a `<ViewTransition>`, or the boundary changes size/position due to an immediate sibling. With nested `<ViewTransition>`s, the mutation applies to the innermost one, not the parent |
| **share** | A named `<ViewTransition>` unmounts and another with the same `name` mounts in the same Transition (shared element transition) |

Only updates wrapped in `startTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, or `Suspense` activate `<ViewTransition>`. Regular `setState` updates immediately and does not animate.

### Critical Placement Rule

`<ViewTransition>` only activates enter/exit if it appears **before any DOM nodes** in the component tree:

```jsx
// Works — ViewTransition is before the DOM node
function Item() {
  return (
    <ViewTransition enter="auto" exit="auto">
      <div>Content</div>
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}

// Broken — a <div> wraps the ViewTransition, preventing enter/exit
function Item() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ViewTransition enter="auto" exit="auto">
        <div>Content</div>
      </ViewTransition>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Styling Animations with View Transition Classes

### Props

Each prop controls a different animation trigger. Values can be:

- `"auto"` — use the browser default cross-fade
- `"none"` — disable this animation type
- `"my-class-name"` — a custom CSS class
- An object `{ [transitionType]: value }` for type-specific animations (see Transition Types below)

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  default="none"          // disable everything not explicitly listed
  enter="slide-in"        // CSS class for enter animations
  exit="slide-out"        // CSS class for exit animations
  update="cross-fade"     // CSS class for update animations
  share="morph"           // CSS class for shared element animations
/>
```

If `default` is `"none"`, all triggers are off unless explicitly listed.

### Defining CSS Animations

Use the view transition pseudo-element selectors with the class name:

```css
::view-transition-old(.slide-in) {
  animation: 300ms ease-out slide-out-to-left;
}
::view-transition-new(.slide-in) {
  animation: 300ms ease-out slide-in-from-right;
}

@keyframes slide-out-to-left {
  to { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }
}
@keyframes slide-in-from-right {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
}
```

The pseudo-elements available are:

- `::view-transition-group(.class)` — the container for the transition
- `::view-transition-image-pair(.class)` — contains old and new snapshots
- `::view-transition-old(.class)` — the outgoing snapshot
- `::view-transition-new(.class)` — the incoming snapshot

---

## Transition Types with `addTransitionType`

`addTransitionType` lets you tag a transition with a string label so `<ViewTransition>` can pick different animations based on *what caused* the change. This is essential for directional navigation (forward vs. back) or distinguishing user actions (click vs. swipe vs. keyboard).

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';

function navigate(url, direction) {
  startTransition(() => {
    addTransitionType(`navigation-${direction}`); // "navigation-forward" or "navigation-back"
    setCurrentPage(url);
  });
}
```

You can add multiple types to a single transition, and if multiple transitions are batched, all types are collected.

### Using Types with View Transition Classes

Pass an object instead of a string to any activation prop. Keys are transition type strings, values are CSS class names:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-in-from-right',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-in-from-left',
    default: 'fade-in',
  }}
  exit={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-out-to-left',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-out-to-right',
    default: 'fade-out',
  }}
>
  <Page />
</ViewTransition>
```

The `default` key inside the object is the fallback when no type matches.

### Using Types with CSS `:active-view-transition-type()`

React adds transition types as browser view transition types, enabling CSS scoping with `:root:active-view-transition-type(type-name)`. **Caveat:** `::view-transition-old(*)` / `::view-transition-new(*)` match **all** named elements — prefer class-based props for per-component animations; reserve `:active-view-transition-type()` for global rules.

### Types and Suspense: When Types Are Available

When a `<Link>` with `transitionTypes` triggers navigation, the transition type is available to **all `<ViewTransition>`s that enter/exit during that navigation**. An outer page-level `<ViewTransition>` with a type map sees the type and responds. Inner `<ViewTransition>`s with simple string props also enter — the type is irrelevant to them because simple strings fire regardless of type.

Subsequent Suspense reveals — when streamed data loads after navigation completes — are **separate transitions with no type**. This means type-keyed props on Suspense content don't work:

```jsx
// This does NOT animate on Suspense reveal — the type is gone by then
<ViewTransition enter={{ "nav-forward": "slide-up", default: "none" }} default="none">
  <AsyncContent />
</ViewTransition>
```

When Suspense resolves later, a new transition fires with no type — so `default: "none"` applies and nothing animates.

**Use type maps for `<ViewTransition>`s that enter/exit directly with the navigation. Use simple string props for Suspense reveals.** See the two-layer pattern in "Two Patterns — Can Coexist with Proper Isolation" below for a complete example.

---

## Shared Element Transitions

Assign the same `name` to two `<ViewTransition>` components — one in the unmounting tree and one in the mounting tree — to animate between them as if they're the same element:

```jsx
const HERO_IMAGE = 'hero-image';

function ListView({ onSelect }) {
  return (
    <ViewTransition name={HERO_IMAGE}>
      <img src="/thumb.jpg" onClick={() => startTransition(() => onSelect())} />
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}

function DetailView() {
  return (
    <ViewTransition name={HERO_IMAGE}>
      <img src="/full.jpg" />
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

Rules for shared element transitions:
- Only one `<ViewTransition>` with a given `name` can be mounted at a time — use globally unique names (namespace with a prefix or module constant).
- The "share" trigger takes precedence over "enter"/"exit".
- If either side is outside the viewport, no pair forms and each side animates independently as enter/exit.
- If a Suspense fallback appears between unmounting one side and mounting the other, no shared element pair forms.
- Use a constant defined in a shared module to avoid name collisions.

## View Transition Events (JavaScript Animations)

For imperative control with `onEnter`, `onExit`, `onUpdate`, `onShare` callbacks and the `instance` object, see `references/patterns.md`. Always return a cleanup function. `onShare` takes precedence over `onEnter`/`onExit`.

---

## Common Patterns

### Animate Enter/Exit of a Component

Conditionally render the `<ViewTransition>` itself — toggle with `startTransition`:

```jsx
{show && (
  <ViewTransition enter="fade-in" exit="fade-out">
    <Panel />
  </ViewTransition>
)}
```

### Animate List Reorder

Wrap each item (not a wrapper div) in `<ViewTransition>` with a stable `key`:

```jsx
{items.map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id}>
    <ItemCard item={item} />
  </ViewTransition>
))}
```

Trigger the reorder inside `startTransition`. Avoid wrapper `<div>`s between the list and `<ViewTransition>` — they block the reorder animation. `startTransition` doesn't need async work — the View Transition API captures before/after snapshots and animates position changes, even for synchronous state changes like sorting.

### Force Re-Enter with `key`

Use a `key` prop on `<ViewTransition>` to force an enter/exit animation when a value changes — even if the component itself doesn't unmount:

```jsx
<ViewTransition key={searchParams.toString()} enter="slide-up" exit="slide-down" default="none">
  <ResultsGrid results={results} />
</ViewTransition>
```

When the key changes, React unmounts and remounts the `<ViewTransition>`, triggering exit on the old instance and enter on the new one.

**Caution with Suspense:** If the `<ViewTransition>` wraps a `<Suspense>`, changing the key remounts the entire Suspense boundary, re-triggering the data fetch. Only use `key` on `<ViewTransition>` outside of Suspense, or accept the refetch.

**Alternative for tabs:** For tab switches within a persistent layout, omitting `key` keeps the `<ViewTransition>` mounted and triggers an update animation (cross-fade) instead of exit + enter — avoiding Suspense remount and refetch. See "Cross-Fade Without Remount" in `references/patterns.md`.

### Animate Suspense Fallback to Content

The simplest approach: wrap `<Suspense>` in a single `<ViewTransition>` for a zero-config cross-fade from skeleton to content:

```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
    <Content />
  </Suspense>
</ViewTransition>
```

For directional motion, give the fallback and content separate `<ViewTransition>`s. Use `default="none"` on the content to prevent re-animation on revalidation:

```jsx
<Suspense
  fallback={
    <ViewTransition exit="slide-down">
      <Skeleton />
    </ViewTransition>
  }
>
  <ViewTransition default="none" enter="slide-up">
    <AsyncContent />
  </ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

When Suspense resolves, the fallback unmounts (exit) and content mounts (enter) simultaneously. Staggered CSS timing (`enter` delays by the `exit` duration) ensures the skeleton leaves before new content arrives. Keep skeleton dimensions close to the real content — large size mismatches produce jarring staggers.

### Opt Out of Nested Animations

Wrap children in `<ViewTransition update="none">` to prevent them from animating when a parent changes:

```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <div className={theme}>
    <ViewTransition update="none">
      {children}
    </ViewTransition>
  </div>
</ViewTransition>
```

For more patterns (isolate persistent/floating elements, reusable animated collapse, preserve state with `<Activity>`, exclude elements with `useOptimistic`), see `references/patterns.md`.

---

## How Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s Interact

When a transition fires, **every** `<ViewTransition>` in the tree that matches the trigger participates simultaneously inside a single `document.startViewTransition` call. Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s in the **same** transition animate at once and can compete. `<ViewTransition>`s in **different** transitions (e.g., navigation vs. a later Suspense resolve) don't compete — they animate at different moments.

### Use `default="none"` Liberally

Prevent unintended animations by disabling the default trigger on ViewTransitions that should only fire for specific types:

```jsx
// Only animates when 'navigation-forward' or 'navigation-back' types are present.
// Silent on all other transitions (Suspense reveals, state changes, etc.)
<ViewTransition
  default="none"
  enter={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-in-from-right',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-in-from-left',
    default: 'none',
  }}
  exit={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-out-to-left',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-out-to-right',
    default: 'none',
  }}
>
  {children}
</ViewTransition>
```

**TypeScript note:** When passing an object to `enter`/`exit`, `ViewTransitionClassPerType` requires a `default` key — omitting it causes a type error even if the component-level `default` prop is set.

Without `default="none"`, a `<ViewTransition>` fires the browser's cross-fade on **every** transition — including Suspense resolves, `useDeferredValue` updates, and `revalidateTag()` re-renders in Next.js. Always use `default="none"` on content `<ViewTransition>`s and only enable specific triggers explicitly.

### Two Patterns — Can Coexist with Proper Isolation

There are two distinct view transition patterns:

**Pattern A — Directional page slides** (e.g., left/right navigation):
- Uses `transitionTypes` on `<Link>` or `addTransitionType` to tag navigation direction
- An outer `<ViewTransition>` on the page maps types to slide classes with `default="none"`
- Fires during the navigation transition (when the type is present)

**Pattern B — Suspense content reveals** (e.g., streaming data):
- No `transitionTypes` needed
- Simple `enter="slide-up"` / `exit="slide-down"` on `<ViewTransition>`s around Suspense boundaries
- `default="none"` prevents re-animation on revalidation
- Fires later when data loads (a separate transition with no type)

**These coexist when they fire at different moments.** The nav slide fires during the navigation transition (with the type); the Suspense reveal fires later when data streams in (no type). `default="none"` on both layers prevents cross-interference — the nav VT ignores Suspense resolves, and the Suspense VT ignores navigations:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{ "nav-forward": "slide-from-right", default: "none" }}
  exit={{ "nav-forward": "slide-to-left", default: "none" }}
  default="none"
>
  <div>
    <Suspense fallback={
      <ViewTransition exit="slide-down"><Skeleton /></ViewTransition>
    }>
      <ViewTransition enter="slide-up" default="none">
        <Content />
      </ViewTransition>
    </Suspense>
  </div>
</ViewTransition>
```

**Always pair `enter` with `exit` on directional transitions.** Without an exit animation, the old page disappears instantly while the new one slides in — a jarring jump.

**When they DO conflict:** If both layers use `default="auto"`, they animate simultaneously and fight for attention. The conflict is about **same-moment** animations, not about using both patterns on the same page. Place the outer directional `<ViewTransition>` in each **page component** — not in a layout (layouts persist and don't trigger enter/exit).

Shared element transitions (`name` prop) work alongside either pattern because `share` takes precedence over `enter`/`exit`.

---

## Next.js Integration

Next.js supports React View Transitions. `<ViewTransition>` works out of the box for `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates — no config needed.

To also animate `<Link>` navigations, enable the experimental flag in `next.config.js` (or `next.config.ts`):

```js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

**What this flag does:** It wraps every `<Link>` navigation in `document.startViewTransition`, so all mounted `<ViewTransition>` components participate in every link click. Without this flag, only `startTransition`/`Suspense`-triggered transitions animate. This makes the composition rules in "How Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s Interact" especially important: use `default="none"` on layout-level `<ViewTransition>`s to avoid competing animations.

**Production warning:** As of Next.js 16, the `viewTransition` flag is experimental and the Next.js team advises against using it in production. The flag opts into React's experimental build. `<ViewTransition>` itself works without the flag for `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates.

For a detailed guide including App Router patterns and Server Component considerations, see `references/nextjs.md`.

Key points:
- The `<ViewTransition>` component is imported from `react` directly — no Next.js-specific import.
- Works with the App Router and `startTransition` + `router.push()` for programmatic navigation.

### The `transitionTypes` prop on `next/link`

`next/link` supports a native `transitionTypes` prop — pass an array of strings directly, no `'use client'` or wrapper component needed:

```tsx
<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['transition-to-detail']}>View Product</Link>
```

For full examples with shared element transitions and directional animations, see `references/nextjs.md`.

---

## Accessibility

Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. React does not disable animations automatically for this preference. Add this to your global CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-old(*),
  ::view-transition-new(*),
  ::view-transition-group(*) {
    animation-duration: 0s !important;
    animation-delay: 0s !important;
  }
}
```

Or disable specific animations conditionally in JavaScript events by checking the media query.
