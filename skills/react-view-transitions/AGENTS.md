# React View Transitions

**Version 1.0.0**
Vercel

React's View Transition API lets you animate between UI states using the browser's native `document.startViewTransition` under the hood. Declare *what* to animate with `<ViewTransition>`, trigger *when* with `startTransition` / `useDeferredValue` / `Suspense`, and control *how* with CSS classes or the Web Animations API. Unsupported browsers skip the animation and apply the DOM change instantly.

## When to Animate (and When Not To)

Every `<ViewTransition>` should answer: **what spatial relationship or continuity does this animation communicate to the user?** If you can't articulate it, don't add it.

### Hierarchy of Animation Intent

From highest value to lowest — start from the top and only move down if your app doesn't already have animations at that level:

| Priority | Pattern | What it communicates | Example |
|----------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Shared element** (`name`) | "This is the same thing — I'm going deeper" | List thumbnail morphs into detail hero |
| 2 | **Suspense reveal** | "Data loaded, here's the real content" | Skeleton cross-fades into loaded page |
| 3 | **List identity** (per-item `key`) | "Same items, new arrangement" | Cards reorder during sort/filter |
| 4 | **State change** (`enter`/`exit`) | "Something appeared or disappeared" | Panel slides in on toggle |
| 5 | **Route change** (layout-level) | "Going to a new place" | Cross-fade between pages |

Route-level transitions (#5) are the lowest priority because the URL change already signals a context switch. A blanket cross-fade on every navigation says nothing — it's visual noise. Prefer specific, intentional animations (#1–#4) over ambient page transitions.

**Rule of thumb:** at any given moment, only one level of the tree should be visually transitioning. If your pages already manage their own Suspense reveals or shared element morphs, adding a layout-level route transition on top produces double-animation where both levels fight for attention.

### Choosing the Right Animation Style

Not everything should slide. Match the animation to the spatial relationship:

| Context | Animation | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Detail page main content | `enter="slide-up"` | Reveals "deeper" content the user drilled into |
| Detail page outer wrapper | `enter`/`exit` type map for `nav-forward` | Navigating forward — horizontal direction |
| List / overview pages | Bare `<ViewTransition>` (fade) or `default="none"` | Lateral navigation — no spatial depth to communicate |
| Page headers / breadcrumbs | Bare `<ViewTransition>` (fade) | Small, fast-loading metadata — slide feels excessive |
| Secondary section on same page | `enter="slide-up"` | Second Suspense boundary streaming in after the header |
| Revalidation / background refresh | `default="none"` | Data refreshed silently — animation would be distracting |

When in doubt, use a bare `<ViewTransition>` (default cross-fade) or `default="none"`. Only add directional motion (slide-up, slide-from-right) when it communicates spatial meaning.

**Hierarchical vs. lateral navigation:** Reserve directional `transitionTypes` (like `nav-forward` / `nav-back`) for hierarchical navigation — where the user drills deeper (list → detail) or backs out. For lateral/sibling navigation between pages at the same level (e.g., tab-to-tab or peer sections), use a bare `<ViewTransition>` (cross-fade) or `default="none"` — don't add `transitionTypes`. Directional slides on sibling links falsely imply spatial depth where none exists.

---

## Availability

- `<ViewTransition>` and `addTransitionType` require `react@canary` or `react@experimental`. They are **not** in stable React (including 19.x). Before implementing, verify the project uses canary — check `package.json` for `"react": "canary"` or run `npm ls react`. If on stable, install canary: `npm install react@canary react-dom@canary`.
- Browser support: Chromium 111+, Firefox 144+, Safari 18.2+ (cross-document only). The API gracefully degrades — unsupported browsers skip the animation and apply the DOM change instantly.

---

## Core Concepts

### The `<ViewTransition>` Component

Wrap the elements you want to animate:

```jsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

<ViewTransition>
  <Component />
</ViewTransition>
```

React automatically assigns a unique `view-transition-name` to the nearest DOM node inside each `<ViewTransition>`, and calls `document.startViewTransition` behind the scenes. Never call `startViewTransition` yourself — React coordinates all view transitions and will interrupt external ones. React also waits up to 500ms for fonts to load and delays for images inside `<ViewTransition>` to avoid flicker.

### Animation Triggers

React decides which type of animation to run based on what changed:

| Trigger | When it fires |
|---------|--------------|
| **enter** | A `<ViewTransition>` is first inserted during a Transition |
| **exit** | A `<ViewTransition>` is first removed during a Transition |
| **update** | DOM mutations happen inside a `<ViewTransition>`, or the boundary changes size/position due to an immediate sibling. With nested `<ViewTransition>`s, the mutation applies to the innermost one, not the parent |
| **share** | A named `<ViewTransition>` unmounts and another with the same `name` mounts in the same Transition (shared element transition) |

Only updates wrapped in `startTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, or `Suspense` activate `<ViewTransition>`. Regular `setState` updates immediately and does not animate.

### Critical Placement Rule

`<ViewTransition>` only activates enter/exit if it appears **before any DOM nodes** in the component tree:

```jsx
// Works — ViewTransition is before the DOM node
function Item() {
  return (
    <ViewTransition enter="auto" exit="auto">
      <div>Content</div>
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}

// Broken — a <div> wraps the ViewTransition, preventing enter/exit
function Item() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ViewTransition enter="auto" exit="auto">
        <div>Content</div>
      </ViewTransition>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Styling Animations with View Transition Classes

### Props

Each prop controls a different animation trigger. Values can be:

- `"auto"` — use the browser default cross-fade
- `"none"` — disable this animation type
- `"my-class-name"` — a custom CSS class
- An object `{ [transitionType]: value }` for type-specific animations (see Transition Types below)

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  default="none"          // disable everything not explicitly listed
  enter="slide-in"        // CSS class for enter animations
  exit="slide-out"        // CSS class for exit animations
  update="cross-fade"     // CSS class for update animations
  share="morph"           // CSS class for shared element animations
/>
```

If `default` is `"none"`, all triggers are off unless explicitly listed.

### Defining CSS Animations

Use the view transition pseudo-element selectors with the class name:

```css
::view-transition-old(.slide-in) {
  animation: 300ms ease-out slide-out-to-left;
}
::view-transition-new(.slide-in) {
  animation: 300ms ease-out slide-in-from-right;
}

@keyframes slide-out-to-left {
  to { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }
}
@keyframes slide-in-from-right {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
}
```

The pseudo-elements available are:

- `::view-transition-group(.class)` — the container for the transition
- `::view-transition-image-pair(.class)` — contains old and new snapshots
- `::view-transition-old(.class)` — the outgoing snapshot
- `::view-transition-new(.class)` — the incoming snapshot

---

## Transition Types with `addTransitionType`

`addTransitionType` lets you tag a transition with a string label so `<ViewTransition>` can pick different animations based on *what caused* the change. This is essential for directional navigation (forward vs. back) or distinguishing user actions (click vs. swipe vs. keyboard).

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';

function navigate(url, direction) {
  startTransition(() => {
    addTransitionType(`navigation-${direction}`); // "navigation-forward" or "navigation-back"
    setCurrentPage(url);
  });
}
```

You can add multiple types to a single transition, and if multiple transitions are batched, all types are collected.

### Using Types with View Transition Classes

Pass an object instead of a string to any activation prop. Keys are transition type strings, values are CSS class names:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-in-from-right',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-in-from-left',
    default: 'fade-in',
  }}
  exit={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-out-to-left',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-out-to-right',
    default: 'fade-out',
  }}
>
  <Page />
</ViewTransition>
```

The `default` key inside the object is the fallback when no type matches.

### Using Types with CSS `:active-view-transition-type()`

React adds transition types as browser view transition types, enabling CSS scoping with `:root:active-view-transition-type(type-name)`. **Caveat:** `::view-transition-old(*)` / `::view-transition-new(*)` match **all** named elements — prefer class-based props for per-component animations; reserve `:active-view-transition-type()` for global rules.

### Types and Suspense: When Types Are Available

When a `<Link>` with `transitionTypes` triggers navigation, the transition type is available to **all `<ViewTransition>`s that enter/exit during that navigation**. An outer page-level `<ViewTransition>` with a type map sees the type and responds. Inner `<ViewTransition>`s with simple string props also enter — the type is irrelevant to them because simple strings fire regardless of type.

Subsequent Suspense reveals — when streamed data loads after navigation completes — are **separate transitions with no type**. This means type-keyed props on Suspense content don't work:

```jsx
// This does NOT animate on Suspense reveal — the type is gone by then
<ViewTransition enter={{ "nav-forward": "slide-up", default: "none" }} default="none">
  <AsyncContent />
</ViewTransition>
```

When Suspense resolves later, a new transition fires with no type — so `default: "none"` applies and nothing animates.

**Use type maps for `<ViewTransition>`s that enter/exit directly with the navigation. Use simple string props for Suspense reveals.** See the two-layer pattern in "Two Patterns — Can Coexist with Proper Isolation" below for a complete example.

---

## Shared Element Transitions

Assign the same `name` to two `<ViewTransition>` components — one in the unmounting tree and one in the mounting tree — to animate between them as if they're the same element:

```jsx
const HERO_IMAGE = 'hero-image';

function ListView({ onSelect }) {
  return (
    <ViewTransition name={HERO_IMAGE}>
      <img src="/thumb.jpg" onClick={() => startTransition(() => onSelect())} />
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}

function DetailView() {
  return (
    <ViewTransition name={HERO_IMAGE}>
      <img src="/full.jpg" />
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

Rules for shared element transitions:
- Only one `<ViewTransition>` with a given `name` can be mounted at a time — use globally unique names (namespace with a prefix or module constant).
- The "share" trigger takes precedence over "enter"/"exit".
- If either side is outside the viewport, no pair forms and each side animates independently as enter/exit.
- If a Suspense fallback appears between unmounting one side and mounting the other, no shared element pair forms.
- Use a constant defined in a shared module to avoid name collisions.

---

## View Transition Events (JavaScript Animations)

For imperative control with `onEnter`, `onExit`, `onUpdate`, `onShare` callbacks and the `instance` object, see **Patterns and Guidelines** below. Always return a cleanup function. `onShare` takes precedence over `onEnter`/`onExit`.

---

## Common Patterns

### Animate Enter/Exit of a Component

Conditionally render the `<ViewTransition>` itself — toggle with `startTransition`:

```jsx
{show && (
  <ViewTransition enter="fade-in" exit="fade-out">
    <Panel />
  </ViewTransition>
)}
```

### Animate List Reorder

Wrap each item (not a wrapper div) in `<ViewTransition>` with a stable `key`:

```jsx
{items.map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id}>
    <ItemCard item={item} />
  </ViewTransition>
))}
```

Trigger the reorder inside `startTransition`. Avoid wrapper `<div>`s between the list and `<ViewTransition>` — they block the reorder animation. `startTransition` doesn't need async work — the View Transition API captures before/after snapshots and animates position changes, even for synchronous state changes like sorting.

### Force Re-Enter with `key`

Use a `key` prop on `<ViewTransition>` to force an enter/exit animation when a value changes — even if the component itself doesn't unmount:

```jsx
<ViewTransition key={searchParams.toString()} enter="slide-up" exit="slide-down" default="none">
  <ResultsGrid results={results} />
</ViewTransition>
```

When the key changes, React unmounts and remounts the `<ViewTransition>`, triggering exit on the old instance and enter on the new one.

**Caution with Suspense:** If the `<ViewTransition>` wraps a `<Suspense>`, changing the key remounts the entire Suspense boundary, re-triggering the data fetch. Only use `key` on `<ViewTransition>` outside of Suspense, or accept the refetch.

**Alternative for tabs:** For tab switches within a persistent layout, omitting `key` keeps the `<ViewTransition>` mounted and triggers an update animation (cross-fade) instead of exit + enter — avoiding Suspense remount and refetch. See "Cross-Fade Without Remount" below.

### Animate Suspense Fallback to Content

The simplest approach: wrap `<Suspense>` in a single `<ViewTransition>` for a zero-config cross-fade from skeleton to content:

```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
    <Content />
  </Suspense>
</ViewTransition>
```

For directional motion, give the fallback and content separate `<ViewTransition>`s. Use `default="none"` on the content to prevent re-animation on revalidation:

```jsx
<Suspense
  fallback={
    <ViewTransition exit="slide-down">
      <Skeleton />
    </ViewTransition>
  }
>
  <ViewTransition default="none" enter="slide-up">
    <AsyncContent />
  </ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

When Suspense resolves, the fallback unmounts (exit) and content mounts (enter) simultaneously. Staggered CSS timing (`enter` delays by the `exit` duration) ensures the skeleton leaves before new content arrives. Keep skeleton dimensions close to the real content — large size mismatches produce jarring staggers.

### Opt Out of Nested Animations

Wrap children in `<ViewTransition update="none">` to prevent them from animating when a parent changes:

```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <div className={theme}>
    <ViewTransition update="none">
      {children}
    </ViewTransition>
  </div>
</ViewTransition>
```

For more patterns (isolate persistent/floating elements, reusable animated collapse, preserve state with `<Activity>`, exclude elements with `useOptimistic`), see **Patterns and Guidelines** below.

---

## How Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s Interact

When a transition fires, **every** `<ViewTransition>` in the tree that matches the trigger participates simultaneously inside a single `document.startViewTransition` call. Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s in the **same** transition animate at once and can compete. `<ViewTransition>`s in **different** transitions (e.g., navigation vs. a later Suspense resolve) don't compete — they animate at different moments.

### Use `default="none"` Liberally

Prevent unintended animations by disabling the default trigger on ViewTransitions that should only fire for specific types:

```jsx
// Only animates when 'navigation-forward' or 'navigation-back' types are present.
// Silent on all other transitions (Suspense reveals, state changes, etc.)
<ViewTransition
  default="none"
  enter={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-in-from-right',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-in-from-left',
    default: 'none',
  }}
  exit={{
    'navigation-forward': 'slide-out-to-left',
    'navigation-back': 'slide-out-to-right',
    default: 'none',
  }}
>
  {children}
</ViewTransition>
```

**TypeScript note:** When passing an object to `enter`/`exit`, `ViewTransitionClassPerType` requires a `default` key — omitting it causes a type error even if the component-level `default` prop is set.

Without `default="none"`, a `<ViewTransition>` fires the browser's cross-fade on **every** transition — including Suspense resolves, `useDeferredValue` updates, and `revalidateTag()` re-renders in Next.js. Always use `default="none"` on content `<ViewTransition>`s and only enable specific triggers explicitly.

### Two Patterns — Can Coexist with Proper Isolation

There are two distinct view transition patterns:

**Pattern A — Directional page slides** (e.g., left/right navigation):
- Uses `transitionTypes` on `<Link>` or `addTransitionType` to tag navigation direction
- An outer `<ViewTransition>` on the page maps types to slide classes with `default="none"`
- Fires during the navigation transition (when the type is present)

**Pattern B — Suspense content reveals** (e.g., streaming data):
- No `transitionTypes` needed
- Simple `enter="slide-up"` / `exit="slide-down"` on `<ViewTransition>`s around Suspense boundaries
- `default="none"` prevents re-animation on revalidation
- Fires later when data loads (a separate transition with no type)

**These coexist when they fire at different moments.** The nav slide fires during the navigation transition (with the type); the Suspense reveal fires later when data streams in (no type). `default="none"` on both layers prevents cross-interference — the nav VT ignores Suspense resolves, and the Suspense VT ignores navigations:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{ "nav-forward": "slide-from-right", default: "none" }}
  exit={{ "nav-forward": "slide-to-left", default: "none" }}
  default="none"
>
  <div>
    <Suspense fallback={
      <ViewTransition exit="slide-down"><Skeleton /></ViewTransition>
    }>
      <ViewTransition enter="slide-up" default="none">
        <Content />
      </ViewTransition>
    </Suspense>
  </div>
</ViewTransition>
```

**Always pair `enter` with `exit` on directional transitions.** Without an exit animation, the old page disappears instantly while the new one slides in — a jarring jump.

**When they DO conflict:** If both layers use `default="auto"`, they animate simultaneously and fight for attention. The conflict is about **same-moment** animations, not about using both patterns on the same page. Place the outer directional `<ViewTransition>` in each **page component** — not in a layout (layouts persist and don't trigger enter/exit).

Shared element transitions (`name` prop) work alongside either pattern because `share` takes precedence over `enter`/`exit`.

---

## Next.js Integration

Next.js supports React View Transitions. `<ViewTransition>` works out of the box for `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates — no config needed.

To also animate `<Link>` navigations, enable the experimental flag in `next.config.js` (or `next.config.ts`):

```js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

**What this flag does:** It wraps every `<Link>` navigation in `document.startViewTransition`, so all mounted `<ViewTransition>` components participate in every link click. Without this flag, only `startTransition`/`Suspense`-triggered transitions animate. This makes the composition rules in "How Multiple `<ViewTransition>`s Interact" especially important: use `default="none"` on layout-level `<ViewTransition>`s to avoid competing animations.

**Production warning:** As of Next.js 16, the `viewTransition` flag is experimental and the Next.js team advises against using it in production. The flag opts into React's experimental build. `<ViewTransition>` itself works without the flag for `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates.

For a detailed guide including App Router patterns and Server Component considerations, see **View Transitions in Next.js** below.

Key points:
- The `<ViewTransition>` component is imported from `react` directly — no Next.js-specific import.
- Works with the App Router and `startTransition` + `router.push()` for programmatic navigation.

### The `transitionTypes` prop on `next/link`

`next/link` supports a native `transitionTypes` prop — pass an array of strings directly, no `'use client'` or wrapper component needed:

```tsx
<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['transition-to-detail']}>View Product</Link>
```

For full examples with shared element transitions and directional animations, see **View Transitions in Next.js** below.

---

## Accessibility

Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. React does not disable animations automatically for this preference. Add this to your global CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-old(*),
  ::view-transition-new(*),
  ::view-transition-group(*) {
    animation-duration: 0s !important;
    animation-delay: 0s !important;
  }
}
```

Or disable specific animations conditionally in JavaScript events by checking the media query.

---

# Patterns and Guidelines

## Searchable Grid with `useDeferredValue`

A client-side searchable grid where the filtered results cross-fade as the user types. `useDeferredValue` makes the filter update a transition, which activates the wrapping `<ViewTransition>`:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useDeferredValue, useState, ViewTransition, Suspense } from 'react';

export default function SearchableGrid({ itemsPromise }) {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
  const deferredSearch = useDeferredValue(search);

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.currentTarget.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
      <ViewTransition>
        <Suspense fallback={<GridSkeleton />}>
          <ItemGrid itemsPromise={itemsPromise} search={deferredSearch} />
        </Suspense>
      </ViewTransition>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Named Shared Elements Inside `useDeferredValue` Lists

Per-item `<ViewTransition name={...} share="morph">` inside a `useDeferredValue`-driven list triggers update animations on every keystroke — each named element gets its own cross-fade, which can look noisy or washed-out. The searchable grid above avoids this with a single unnamed `<ViewTransition>`. If you need per-item shared elements (for card-to-detail morph), add `default="none"`:

```tsx
{filteredItems.map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id} name={`item-${item.id}`} share="morph" default="none">
    <ItemCard item={item} />
  </ViewTransition>
))}
```

The morph still fires on navigation when the element unmounts and a matching `name` mounts elsewhere.

## Card Expand/Collapse with `startTransition`

Toggle between a card grid and a detail view using `startTransition` to animate the swap. Add a shared element `name` to morph the card into the detail view:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState, useRef, startTransition, ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function ItemGrid({ items }) {
  const [expandedId, setExpandedId] = useState(null);
  const scrollRef = useRef(0);

  return expandedId ? (
    <ViewTransition enter="slide-in" name={`item-${expandedId}`}>
      <ItemDetail
        item={items.find(i => i.id === expandedId)}
        onClose={() => {
          startTransition(() => {
            setExpandedId(null);
            setTimeout(() => window.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth', top: scrollRef.current }), 100);
          });
        }}
      />
    </ViewTransition>
  ) : (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {items.map(item => (
        <ViewTransition key={item.id} name={`item-${item.id}`}>
          <ItemCard
            item={item}
            onSelect={() => {
              scrollRef.current = window.scrollY;
              startTransition(() => setExpandedId(item.id));
            }}
          />
        </ViewTransition>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The shared `name={`item-${id}`}` on both the card and detail `<ViewTransition>` creates a shared element pair — the card morphs into the detail view. The `scrollRef` saves and restores scroll position so users return to where they were in the grid. See **CSS Animation Recipes** below for the slide-up/slide-down CSS.

## Type-Safe Transition Helpers

For larger apps, define type-safe transition IDs and transition maps to prevent ID clashes and keep animation configurations consistent. Use `as const` arrays for transition IDs, types, and animation classes, then derive types from them:

```tsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

const transitionTypes = ['default', 'transition-to-detail', 'transition-to-list', 'transition-backwards', 'transition-forwards'] as const;
const animationTypes = ['auto', 'none', 'animate-slide-from-left', 'animate-slide-from-right', 'animate-slide-to-left', 'animate-slide-to-right'] as const;

type TransitionType = (typeof transitionTypes)[number];
type AnimationType = (typeof animationTypes)[number];
type TransitionMap = { default: AnimationType } & Partial<Record<Exclude<TransitionType, 'default'>, AnimationType>>;

export function HorizontalTransition({ children, enter, exit }: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  enter: TransitionMap;
  exit: TransitionMap;
}) {
  return <ViewTransition enter={enter} exit={exit}>{children}</ViewTransition>;
}
```

These wrappers enforce that only valid transition IDs and animation classes are used, catching mistakes at compile time.

## Cross-Fade Without Remount (Alternative to `key` for Tabs)

For tab switches within a persistent layout, omitting `key` keeps the `<ViewTransition>` mounted and triggers an update animation (cross-fade) instead of exit + enter. This avoids remounting Suspense boundaries and refetching data:

```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <TabPanel tab={activeTab} />
</ViewTransition>
```

Use `key` when content identity changes and you want a full re-enter animation (component state resets). Omit `key` for cross-fades within a persistent container (tabs, panels, carousel slides).

## Shared Elements Across Routes in Next.js

See **View Transitions in Next.js** below (Shared Elements Across Routes) for complete examples using `transitionTypes` on `next/link` combined with shared element `<ViewTransition name={...}>` for list-to-detail image morph animations.

## Isolate Elements from Parent Animations

### Persistent Layout Elements (Headers, Sidebars, Toolbars)

Elements that persist across navigations (sticky headers, navbars, sidebars, toolbars) get captured in the page content's transition snapshot. When a directional slide animates the page, the persistent element slides away with it — which looks broken.

Fix: give persistent elements their own `viewTransitionName` and disable animation on their transition group:

```jsx
<nav style={{ viewTransitionName: "persistent-nav" }}>
  {/* persistent element content */}
</nav>
```

```css
::view-transition-group(persistent-nav) {
  animation: none;
  z-index: 100;
}
```

This isolates the element into its own transition group that stays static during page slides. It won't be included in the page content's old/new snapshot.

For elements with `backdrop-blur` or `backdrop-filter`, see the Backdrop-Blur Workaround in CSS recipes below.

### Floating Elements (Popovers, Tooltips)

Popovers, tooltips, and dropdowns can also get captured in a parent's view transition snapshot, causing them to ghost or animate unexpectedly. The same pattern applies — give them their own `viewTransitionName`:

```jsx
<SelectPopover style={{ viewTransitionName: 'popover' }}>
  {options}
</SelectPopover>
```

```css
::view-transition-group(popover) {
  z-index: 100;
}
```

For a global fix that ensures all view transition groups render above normal content, use the wildcard selector:

```css
::view-transition-group(*) {
  z-index: 100;
}
```

## Shared Controls Between Skeleton and Content

When a Suspense fallback mirrors controls from the real content (search input, tab bar, filter row), give them the same `viewTransitionName` to form a shared element pair. Without this, the skeleton control slides away while the real one pops in independently:

```jsx
// In fallback skeleton:
<input disabled placeholder="Search..." style={{ viewTransitionName: 'search-input' }} />

// In real content:
<input placeholder="Search..." style={{ viewTransitionName: 'search-input' }} />
```

The matching name morphs the skeleton control into the real one in place. Ensure the element with manual `viewTransitionName` is not the root DOM node inside a `<ViewTransition>` — React applies its auto-generated name to the root node, which would override the manual one.

## Reusable Animated Collapse

For apps with many expand/collapse interactions, extract a reusable wrapper instead of repeating the conditional-render-with-`<ViewTransition>` pattern:

```jsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

function AnimatedCollapse({ open, children }) {
  if (!open) return null;
  return (
    <ViewTransition enter="expand-in" exit="collapse-out">
      {children}
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

Use it with `startTransition` on the toggle:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => startTransition(() => setOpen(o => !o))}>Toggle</button>
<AnimatedCollapse open={open}>
  <SectionContent />
</AnimatedCollapse>
```

## Preserve State with Activity

Use `<Activity>` with `<ViewTransition>` to animate show/hide while preserving component state:

```jsx
import { Activity, ViewTransition, startTransition } from 'react';

<Activity mode={isVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
  <ViewTransition enter="slide-in" exit="slide-out">
    <Sidebar />
  </ViewTransition>
</Activity>
```

## Exclude Elements from a Transition with `useOptimistic`

When a `startTransition` changes both a control (e.g. a button label) and content (e.g. list order), use `useOptimistic` for the control. The optimistic value updates before React's transition snapshot, so it won't animate. The committed state drives the content, which changes within the transition and animates:

```tsx
const [sort, setSort] = useState('newest');
const [optimisticSort, setOptimisticSort] = useOptimistic(sort);

function cycleSort() {
  const nextSort = getNextSort(optimisticSort);
  startTransition(() => {
    setOptimisticSort(nextSort);  // updates before snapshot — no animation
    setSort(nextSort);            // changes within transition — animates
  });
}

// Button uses optimisticSort (instant, excluded from animation)
<button>Sort: {LABELS[optimisticSort]}</button>

// List uses committed sort (changes between snapshots, animates)
{items.sort(comparators[sort]).map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id}>
    <ItemCard item={item} />
  </ViewTransition>
))}
```

`useOptimistic` values resolve before the transition snapshot. Any DOM driven by optimistic state is already in its final form when the "before" snapshot is taken, so it doesn't participate in the `<ViewTransition>`. Only DOM driven by committed state (via `setState`) changes between snapshots and animates.

## View Transition Events (JavaScript Animations)

For imperative control, use the `onEnter`, `onExit`, `onUpdate`, and `onShare` callbacks:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  onEnter={(instance, types) => {
    const anim = instance.new.animate(
      [{ transform: 'scale(0.8)', opacity: 0 }, { transform: 'scale(1)', opacity: 1 }],
      { duration: 300, easing: 'ease-out' }
    );
    return () => anim.cancel();
  }}
  onExit={(instance, types) => {
    const anim = instance.old.animate(
      [{ transform: 'scale(1)', opacity: 1 }, { transform: 'scale(0.8)', opacity: 0 }],
      { duration: 200, easing: 'ease-in' }
    );
    return () => anim.cancel();
  }}
>
  <Component />
</ViewTransition>
```

The `instance` object provides:
- `instance.old` — the `::view-transition-old` pseudo-element
- `instance.new` — the `::view-transition-new` pseudo-element
- `instance.group` — the `::view-transition-group` pseudo-element
- `instance.imagePair` — the `::view-transition-image-pair` pseudo-element
- `instance.name` — the `view-transition-name` string

Always return a cleanup function that cancels the animation so the browser can properly handle interruptions.

Only one event fires per `<ViewTransition>` per Transition. `onShare` takes precedence over `onEnter` and `onExit`.

### Using Types in Event Callbacks

The `types` array is available as the second argument to all event callbacks:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  onEnter={(instance, types) => {
    const duration = types.includes('fast') ? 150 : 500;
    const anim = instance.new.animate(
      [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
      { duration, easing: 'ease-out' }
    );
    return () => anim.cancel();
  }}
>
```

---

## Animation Timing Guidelines

Match duration to the interaction type — direct user actions need fast feedback, while ambient reveals can be slower:

| Interaction | Duration | Rationale |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Direct toggle (expand/collapse, show/hide) | 100–200ms | Responds to a click — must feel instant |
| Route transition (directional slide) | 150–250ms | Brief spatial cue, shouldn't delay navigation |
| Suspense reveal (skeleton → content) | 200–400ms | Soft reveal, content is "arriving" |
| Shared element morph | 300–500ms | Users watch the morph — give it room to breathe |

These are starting points. Test on low-end devices — animations that feel smooth on a fast machine can feel sluggish on mobile.

## Troubleshooting

**ViewTransition not activating:**
- Ensure the `<ViewTransition>` comes before any DOM node in the component (not wrapped in a `<div>`).
- Ensure the state update is inside `startTransition`, not a plain `setState`.

**"Two ViewTransition components with the same name" error:**
- Each `name` must be globally unique across the entire app at any point in time. Add item IDs: `` name={`hero-${item.id}`} ``.

**Back button skips animation:**
- The legacy `popstate` event requires synchronous completion, conflicting with view transitions. Upgrade your router to use the Navigation API for back-button animations.

**Animations from `flushSync` are skipped:**
- `flushSync` completes synchronously, which prevents view transitions from running. Use `startTransition` instead.

**Enter/exit not firing in a client component (only updates animate):**
- `startTransition(() => setState(...))` triggers a Transition, but if the new content isn't behind a `<Suspense>` boundary, React treats the swap as an **update** to the existing tree — not an enter/exit. The `<ViewTransition>` sees its children change but never fully unmounts/remounts, so only `update` animations fire. To get true enter/exit, either conditionally render the `<ViewTransition>` itself (so it mounts/unmounts with the content), or wrap the async content in `<Suspense>` so React can treat the reveal as an insertion.

**Competing / double animations on navigation:**
- Multiple `<ViewTransition>` components at different tree levels (layout + page + items) all fire simultaneously inside a single `document.startViewTransition`. If a layout-level one cross-fades the whole page while a page-level one slides up content, both run at once and fight for attention. Fix: use `default="none"` on the layout-level `<ViewTransition>`, or remove it entirely if pages manage their own animations.

**List reorder not animating with `useOptimistic`:**
- If the optimistic value drives the list sort order, items are already in their final positions before the transition snapshot — there's nothing to animate. Use the optimistic value only for controls (labels, icons) and the committed state (`useState`) for the list sort order.

**TypeScript error: "Property 'default' is missing in type 'ViewTransitionClassPerType'":**
- When passing an object to `enter`/`exit`/`update`/`share`, TypeScript requires a `default` key in the object. This applies even if the component-level `default` prop is set. Always include `default: 'none'` (or `'auto'`) in type-keyed objects.

**Hash fragments cause scroll jumps during view transitions:**
- Links with URL hash fragments (e.g., `/page#section`) trigger the browser's native scroll-to-anchor behavior during the navigation transition. This interferes with directional slide animations — the page scrolls to the anchor while simultaneously sliding horizontally, producing a diagonal jump. If you need to link to a specific section on a detail page, navigate without the hash and handle scroll/expansion programmatically after navigation completes.

**Backdrop-blur flickers on isolated persistent elements:**
- `backdrop-blur` / `backdrop-filter` can render incorrectly in the old snapshot (browser-dependent), causing a flash during cross-fade. Fix: `::view-transition-old(name) { display: none }` + `::view-transition-new(name) { animation: none }`. See Backdrop-Blur Workaround in CSS recipes.

**Named shared elements animate on every `useDeferredValue` update:**
- Per-item `<ViewTransition>` in a deferred list triggers per-item cross-fades on every keystroke. Fix: `default="none"` on each inner `<ViewTransition>`. See "Named Shared Elements Inside `useDeferredValue` Lists" above.

**`border-radius` lost during list reorder or shared element transitions:**
- Snapshots are placed in a flat pseudo-tree, losing the parent's clip. If `border-radius` comes from a parent's `overflow: hidden`, the snapshot shows square corners. Fix: apply `border-radius` directly to the captured element. Alternative: nested view transition groups (`view-transition-group: parent`, Chrome 140+) restore the hierarchy.

**Skeleton controls slide away while real controls pop in independently:**
- Give matching controls in fallback and content the same `viewTransitionName`. See "Shared Controls Between Skeleton and Content" above.

**Batching:**
- If multiple updates occur while an animation is running, React batches them into one. For example: if you navigate A→B, then B→C, then C→D during the first animation, the next animation will go B→D.

# CSS Animation Recipes for View Transitions

Ready-to-use CSS snippets for common view transition animations. Use these class names with `<ViewTransition>` props.

## Table of Contents

1. [Timing Variables](#timing-variables)
2. [Fade](#fade)
3. [Slide (Vertical)](#slide-vertical)
4. [Directional Navigation (Forward / Back)](#directional-navigation)
5. [Shared Element Morph](#shared-element-morph)
6. [Scale](#scale)
7. [Reduced Motion](#reduced-motion)

---

## Timing Variables

Define timing as CSS custom properties so durations are adjustable in one place. Use staggered timing — the enter animation delays by the exit duration so the old content leaves before the new content appears:

```css
:root {
  --duration-exit: 150ms;
  --duration-enter: 210ms;
  --duration-move: 400ms;
}
```

All recipes below reference these variables.

### Shared Keyframes

These reusable keyframes are used across multiple recipes:

```css
@keyframes fade {
  from { filter: blur(3px); opacity: 0; }
  to { filter: blur(0); opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes slide {
  from { translate: var(--slide-offset); }
  to { translate: 0; }
}

@keyframes slide-y {
  from { transform: translateY(var(--slide-y-offset, 10px)); }
  to { transform: translateY(0); }
}
```

The `slide` keyframe uses a CSS variable for direction — set `--slide-offset: -60px` for left, `60px` for right. The same keyframe with `animation-direction: reverse` handles the exit.

---

## Fade

```css
::view-transition-old(.fade-out) {
  animation: var(--duration-exit) ease-in fade reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.fade-in) {
  animation: var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade;
}
```

Usage:
```jsx
<ViewTransition enter="fade-in" exit="fade-out" />
```

---

## Slide (Vertical)

Slide down on exit, slide up on enter — the most common pattern for Suspense fallback-to-content transitions. Uses staggered timing with a fade:

```css
::view-transition-old(.slide-down) {
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-out both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-exit) ease-out both slide-y reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.slide-up) {
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-in var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in both slide-y;
}
```

Usage:
```jsx
<Suspense
  fallback={
    <ViewTransition exit="slide-down">
      <Skeleton />
    </ViewTransition>
  }
>
  <ViewTransition default="none" enter="slide-up">
    <Content />
  </ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

---

## Directional Navigation

### Separate Enter/Exit Classes

Used with the two-layer pattern where `enter` and `exit` map to different class names:

```css
::view-transition-new(.slide-from-right) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}
::view-transition-old(.slide-to-left) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}

::view-transition-new(.slide-from-left) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}
::view-transition-old(.slide-to-right) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}
```

Usage with the two-layer pattern:
```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{ "nav-forward": "slide-from-right", default: "none" }}
  exit={{ "nav-forward": "slide-to-left", default: "none" }}
  default="none"
>
  {children}
</ViewTransition>
```

### Single-Class Approach

Alternatively, a single CSS class name targets both `::view-transition-old` and `::view-transition-new` with different animations. This keeps the JSX simple — `enter="nav-forward"` / `exit="nav-forward"`:

```css
::view-transition-old(.nav-forward) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.nav-forward) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}

::view-transition-old(.nav-back) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.nav-back) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}
```

Usage with transition types:
```jsx
<ViewTransition
  default="none"
  enter={{
    'nav-forward': 'nav-forward',
    'nav-back': 'nav-back',
    default: 'none',
  }}
  exit={{
    'nav-forward': 'nav-forward',
    'nav-back': 'nav-back',
    default: 'none',
  }}
>
  {children}
</ViewTransition>
```

Triggering with `transitionTypes` on `next/link`:
```jsx
<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['nav-forward']}>Next</Link>
<Link href="/products" transitionTypes={['nav-back']}>Back</Link>
```

Or programmatically:
```jsx
startTransition(() => {
  addTransitionType('nav-forward');
  router.push('/next-page');
});
```

---

## Shared Element Morph

For shared element transitions, control the morph duration on `::view-transition-group` and add a motion blur on `::view-transition-image-pair` to smooth fast-moving elements:

```css
::view-transition-group(.morph) {
  animation-duration: var(--duration-move);
}

::view-transition-image-pair(.morph) {
  animation-name: via-blur;
}

@keyframes via-blur {
  30% { filter: blur(3px); }
}
```

The blur at 30% creates a subtle motion-blur effect — fast-moving elements can be visually jarring, and this smooths the transition without adding perceptible delay.

Usage:
```jsx
<ViewTransition name={`product-${id}`} share="morph">
  <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} />
</ViewTransition>
```

---

## Scale

```css
::view-transition-old(.scale-out) {
  animation: var(--duration-exit) ease-in scale-down;
}
::view-transition-new(.scale-in) {
  animation: var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both scale-up;
}

@keyframes scale-down {
  from { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
  to { transform: scale(0.85); opacity: 0; }
}
@keyframes scale-up {
  from { transform: scale(0.85); opacity: 0; }
  to { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
}
```

Usage:
```jsx
<ViewTransition enter="scale-in" exit="scale-out" />
```

---

## Persistent Element Isolation

Prevent persistent elements (sticky headers, navbars, sidebars, toolbars) from being captured in page content's transition snapshot. Give them a `viewTransitionName` in JSX, then disable animation on their group:

```css
::view-transition-group(persistent-nav) {
  animation: none;
  z-index: 100;
}
```

### Backdrop-Blur Workaround

Elements with `backdrop-blur` or `backdrop-filter` can flash during the cross-fade — the old snapshot may render the blur incorrectly or not at all (browser-dependent). To avoid the cross-fade entirely, hide the old snapshot and disable animation on the new one:

```css
::view-transition-old(persistent-nav) {
  display: none;
}
::view-transition-new(persistent-nav) {
  animation: none;
}
```

Use instead of the group-level fix when the isolated element uses composited effects like `backdrop-filter`.

---

## Reduced Motion

Always include this in your global stylesheet to respect user preferences:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-old(*),
  ::view-transition-new(*),
  ::view-transition-group(*) {
    animation-duration: 0s !important;
    animation-delay: 0s !important;
  }
}
```

## Setup

`<ViewTransition>` works in Next.js out of the box for `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates — no config flag is needed for those.

To also animate `<Link>` navigations, enable the experimental flag in `next.config.js` (or `next.config.ts`):

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

**What this flag does at runtime:** It wraps every `<Link>` navigation in `document.startViewTransition`. This means all mounted `<ViewTransition>` components in the tree participate in every link navigation — not just transitions triggered by `startTransition` or `Suspense`.

Implications:
- Any `<ViewTransition>` with `default="auto"` (the implicit default) fires the browser's cross-fade on **every** `<Link>` navigation.
- Combined with per-page `<ViewTransition>` components (Suspense reveals, item animations), this produces competing animations.
- Without this flag, `<ViewTransition>` still works for all `startTransition`- and `Suspense`-triggered updates — only `<Link>` navigations won't participate.

The `<ViewTransition>` component is currently available in `react@canary` and `react@experimental` only:

```bash
npm install react@canary react-dom@canary
```

---

## Layout-Level ViewTransition

**If your pages already have `<ViewTransition>` components (Suspense reveals, item reorder, shared elements), do NOT add a layout-level `<ViewTransition>` wrapping `{children}` with `default="auto"`.** Both levels fire simultaneously inside a single `document.startViewTransition` — the layout cross-fades the entire old page while the new page's own animations run at the same time. The result is competing, broken-looking animations.

This is the most common view transition mistake in Next.js. Every developer tries this first:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx — ONLY use this if pages have NO per-page ViewTransitions
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <nav>{/* navigation links */}</nav>
        <ViewTransition>
          {children}
        </ViewTransition>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

This works for simple apps where pages have **no** `<ViewTransition>` components of their own. The layout detects the content swap on navigation and applies the default cross-fade.

**But the moment any page adds its own `<ViewTransition>` (a Suspense slide-up, an item reorder, a shared element), remove the layout-level one or set `default="none"` on it.** Otherwise both levels animate in parallel, not sequentially.

**Layouts persist across navigations — they never unmount/remount.** `enter`/`exit` props on a `<ViewTransition>` inside a layout only fire when the layout itself first mounts, not on subsequent route changes. Do not use type-keyed `enter`/`exit` maps in a layout for directional navigation — they won't fire.

If you need the layout to stay silent while pages manage their own animations, use `default="none"`:

```tsx
// app/[section]/layout.tsx — prevents layout from interfering with per-page VTs
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function SectionLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>{/* persistent navigation */}</nav>
      <main>
        <ViewTransition default="none">
          {children}
        </ViewTransition>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This ensures the layout doesn't fire the default cross-fade on every navigation, while still allowing per-page `<ViewTransition>` components to work independently.

---

## The `transitionTypes` Prop on `next/link`

`next/link` supports a native `transitionTypes` prop. This eliminates the need for custom wrapper components that intercept navigation with `onNavigate` + `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` + `router.push()`.

### Before (manual wrapper, requires `'use client'`)

```tsx
'use client';

import { addTransitionType, startTransition } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

export function TransitionLink({ type, ...props }: { type: string } & React.ComponentProps<typeof Link>) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <Link
      onNavigate={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        startTransition(() => {
          addTransitionType(type);
          router.push(props.href as string);
        });
      }}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

### After (native prop, no wrapper needed, works in Server Components)

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['transition-to-detail']}>
  View Product
</Link>
```

The `transitionTypes` prop accepts an array of strings. These types are passed to the View Transition system the same way `addTransitionType` would. `<ViewTransition>` components in the tree respond to these types identically.

This is the recommended approach for link-based navigation transitions. Reserve manual `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` for programmatic navigation (buttons, form submissions, etc.) where `next/link` isn't used.

---

## Programmatic Navigation with Transitions

Use `startTransition` with Next.js's `router.push()` to trigger view transitions from code:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';

export function NavigateButton({ href }: { href: string }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        startTransition(() => {
          addTransitionType('navigation-forward');
          router.push(href);
        });
      }}
    >
      Go to {href}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Wrapping `router.push()` in `startTransition` is what activates the `<ViewTransition>` boundaries in the tree.

---

## Transition Types for Navigation Direction

Directional transitions animate forward/backward navigation with horizontal slides. They can coexist with Suspense reveals on the same page when properly isolated — see the two-layer pattern below.

### Using `transitionTypes` on `next/link` (preferred)

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

// Forward navigation
<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['transition-forwards']}>
  Next →
</Link>

// Backward navigation
<Link href="/products" transitionTypes={['transition-backwards']}>
  ← Back
</Link>
```

### Using `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` (for programmatic navigation)

```tsx
'use client';

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';

export function NavigateButton({
  href,
  direction = 'forward',
  children,
}: {
  href: string;
  direction?: 'forward' | 'back';
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        startTransition(() => {
          addTransitionType(`navigation-${direction}`);
          router.push(href);
        });
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Place a `<ViewTransition>` with type-keyed `enter`/`exit` on each **page** (not in a layout — layouts persist and don't trigger enter/exit on navigation):

```tsx
// In each page component — NOT in layout.tsx
<ViewTransition
  default="none"
  enter={{
    'transition-forwards': 'slide-in-from-right',
    'transition-backwards': 'slide-in-from-left',
    default: 'none',
  }}
  exit={{
    'transition-forwards': 'slide-out-to-left',
    'transition-backwards': 'slide-out-to-right',
    default: 'none',
  }}
>
  <PageContent />
</ViewTransition>
```

### Two-Layer Pattern: Directional Nav + Suspense Reveals

Directional nav slides and Suspense content reveals can coexist on the same page because they fire at **different moments**: the nav slide fires during navigation (when the `transitionTypes` type is present), and the Suspense reveal fires later when streamed data loads (a separate transition with no type). `default="none"` on both layers prevents cross-interference:

```tsx
export default function DetailPage() {
  return (
    <ViewTransition
      enter={{ "nav-forward": "slide-from-right", default: "none" }}
      exit={{ "nav-forward": "slide-to-left", default: "none" }}
      default="none"
    >
      <div>
        <Suspense fallback={
          <ViewTransition exit="slide-down"><HeaderSkeleton /></ViewTransition>
        }>
          <ViewTransition enter="slide-up" default="none">
            <Header />
          </ViewTransition>
        </Suspense>
        <Suspense fallback={
          <ViewTransition exit="slide-down"><ContentSkeleton /></ViewTransition>
        }>
          <ViewTransition enter="slide-up" default="none">
            <Content />
          </ViewTransition>
        </Suspense>
      </div>
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

The outer `<ViewTransition>` only fires when `nav-forward` is present — it stays silent during Suspense resolves (no type, `default: "none"`). The inner `<ViewTransition>`s use simple string props — they fire on Suspense resolve regardless of type.

Place the outer wrapper in each **page component**, not in `layout.tsx` (layouts persist, enter/exit won't fire).

## Shared Elements Across Routes

Animate a thumbnail expanding into a full image across route transitions. Use `transitionTypes` on the link to tag the navigation direction:

```tsx
// app/products/page.tsx (list page)
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function ProductList({ products }) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {products.map((product) => (
        <Link
          key={product.id}
          href={`/products/${product.id}`}
          transitionTypes={['transition-to-detail']}
        >
          <ViewTransition name={`product-${product.id}`}>
            <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} width={400} height={300} />
          </ViewTransition>
          <p>{product.name}</p>
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// app/products/[id]/page.tsx (detail page)
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function ProductDetail({ product }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <Link href="/products" transitionTypes={['transition-to-list']}>
        ← Back to Products
      </Link>
      <ViewTransition name={`product-${product.id}`}>
        <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} width={800} height={600} />
      </ViewTransition>
      <h1>{product.name}</h1>
      <p>{product.description}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Only one `<ViewTransition>` with a given name can be mounted at a time. Since Next.js unmounts the old page and mounts the new page within the same transition, the two `product-${product.id}` boundaries form a shared element pair and the image morphs from its thumbnail size to its full size.

## Combining with Suspense and Loading States

Next.js `loading.tsx` files create `<Suspense>` boundaries. Wrap them with `<ViewTransition>` for smooth fallback-to-content reveals. Place the Suspense `<ViewTransition>` in the page, not alongside a layout-level one:

```tsx
// In a page or page-level component — NOT in a layout that also has a ViewTransition on {children}
<Suspense
  fallback={
    <ViewTransition exit="slide-down">
      <PageSkeleton />
    </ViewTransition>
  }
>
  <ViewTransition default="none" enter="slide-up">
    <PageContent />
  </ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

The skeleton slides out, then the content slides in. `default="none"` on the content prevents it from re-animating on unrelated transitions.

**Do not combine this with a layout-level `<ViewTransition>` that has `default="auto"`.** Both fire during the same transition — the layout cross-fades while the Suspense boundary slides up, producing competing animations. Use `default="none"` on layout-level `<ViewTransition>`s, or remove them entirely.

Directional navigation transitions (via `transitionTypes`) can coexist with Suspense reveals when placed as an outer wrapper in the page component with `default="none"` and type-keyed enter/exit — they fire at different moments (see "Two-Layer Pattern" in Transition Types for Navigation Direction).

## Server Components Considerations

- `<ViewTransition>` can be used in both Server and Client Components — it renders no DOM of its own.
- `<Link>` with `transitionTypes` works in Server Components — no `'use client'` directive needed for link-based transitions.
- `addTransitionType` must be called from a Client Component (inside an event handler with `startTransition`).
- `startTransition` for programmatic navigation must be called from a Client Component.
- Navigation via `<Link>` from `next/link` triggers transitions automatically when the experimental flag is enabled.
- Prefer `transitionTypes` on `<Link>` over custom wrapper components. Only use manual `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` + `router.push()` for non-link interactions (buttons, form submissions, etc.).
